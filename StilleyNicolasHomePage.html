          <h3 class="art-title">My history with Dachshunds</h3>
          <p>
            Since I was a little boy, dachshunds have always been a part of my
            life. My grandma had this one named Ossie. He was so cute and was
            the first reason I started to love weiner dogs. Eventually Ossie
            passed away but his memory will never be forgotten.
          </p>
          <p>
            One day my mom decided that we were going to get some new
            dachshunds. We adopted 3 that my aunt was giving away. We kept two
            naming them Loki and Thor and my grandma kept the other one naming
            him Hugh.
          </p>
          <p>
            Loki and Thor were great dogs to live with. They were always so fun
            to have around and loved getting attention from us and playing with
            their toys. My brother and I used to let them sleep with us in our
            beds when they were puppies and when my mom wasn't around we'd
            always let them onto the couch that they weren't allowed on.
          </p>
          <p>
            Loki and Thor are getting old now and are getting grey beards. I've
            also moved out and am in the Army now so I don't get to see them
            very often which sucks. I'm really excited to get my own place one
            day so I can get dachshunds of my own.
